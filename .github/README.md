## Introduction

This project is a part of CS203[^1], designed for computer science students, including the project authors[^2].
Its primary objective is to provide a comprehensive learning experience,
with a specific focus on mastering the foundational principles of data science.

## Dataset Overview

[Corona Virus Covid-19 US Counties dataset][Dataset url][^3] contains essential information related to the COVID-19
pandemic in various administrative regions.
